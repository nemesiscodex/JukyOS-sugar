Building
========

For details see: http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Development_Team/Jhbuild

Sugar-jhbuild will automatically download the latest of Sugar's 
dependencies as well as Sugar itself directly from their source 
repositories, rather than relying on source packages that may have 
become stale. These are generic instructions on how to use jhbuild 
to get up and running with Sugar.

  $ cd sugar-jhbuild
  $ ./sugar-jhbuild update
  $ ./sugar-jhbuild depscheck
  $ ./sugar-jhbuild buildgit 

Running multiple instances on the same machine
==============================================

You can use the SUGAR_PROFILE command line options.
For example:

SUGAR_PROFILE=profile-1 sugar
SUGAR_PROFILE=profile-2 sugar
...
